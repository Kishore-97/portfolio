## Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ CustomerInspire (_April 2024 - Present_)**
I work as a backend engineer, developing new features and enhancing existing ones, for my company's customer loyalty SAAS product. 

A few noteworthy contributions from me are:
- Designed a customtized version of Master Data Services (MDS) with an integrated review and approval mechanism to ensure operational safety of business critical tables.
- Led a team of three in the implementation of the MDS as a microservice and the successful delivery of the feature.
- Enhanced the notification microservice of our SAAS product to allow customers to fine-tune their notification preferences.
- Identified and fixed a critical authentication bug in the system which was causing microservice inter-communication failure.
- Developed a customer de-duplication feature that merges duplicate customer profiles using a profile score
calculated from the data integrity of the profiles. Led to a decrease of 65% in process time for the client.

**Software Engineer Intern @ Kaar Technologies (_September 2022 - April 2024_)**
I developed software automation solutions and low-code crm applications using Microsoft Power Platform, Mendix, and Uipath.

A few noteworthy contributions from me were:
- Developed a project monitoring system using PowerApps that allows project managers to create teams, add/remove
members and generate project reports from a dashboard. Project members can use the portal to update their progress
and post scrum messages on teams.
- Developed a UiPath automation process for onboarding an employee. The process will collect the employee’s details and
transform them to a report for an administrator who can approve or reject the employee’s requests via email. On approval
an offer letter and ID Card would be automatically generated and emailed to the employee.

## Projects
### Sales Forecast - A web application that forecasts sales
[GitHub](https://github.com/Kishore-97/SalesForecast)

A web application that allows you to forecast sales. Leverages multiple Time Series Analysis models and identifies the best fit for the dataset by backwards prediction accuracy. Also performs EDA on the given dataset and showcases various datapoint parameters.

### GEST - A hand gesture controlled HCI interface
[Github](https://github.com/Kishore-97/GEST/tree/master)

An application that allows contactless Human-Computer Interaction(HCI). Leverages OpenCV, Mediapipe and python to track hand gestures via user's camera and automatically perform the associated computer function such increasing/decreasing brightness, volume, playing music etc. 
Also has mouse-mode which lets you to operate a virtual mouse with a complete set of features like double clicking, drag and dropping, scrolling etc. using only hand gestures.
